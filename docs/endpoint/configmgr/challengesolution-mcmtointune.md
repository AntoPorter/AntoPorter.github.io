# Top Challenges and Solutions: Microsoft Configuration Manager to Intune Migration

As organizations continue to modernize their IT infrastructure, migrating from Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (formerly SCCM) to Microsoft Intune is becoming increasingly common. This transition can be complex, but with the right approach, it can be managed smoothly. Here are some of the top challenges organizations face during this migration and practical solutions to overcome them.

---
### 1. **Understanding the Existing Environment**

**Challenge:** One of the first hurdles is gaining a comprehensive understanding of the current Configuration Manager environment. This includes identifying all managed devices, applications, and configurations.

**Solution:** Conduct a thorough inventory audit. Use tools like the Configuration Manager Inventory Tool to gather detailed information about your current setup. This data will be crucial for planning your migration strategy.

### 2. **Application Compatibility**

**Challenge:** Ensuring that all applications currently managed by Configuration Manager are compatible with Intune can be daunting. Some legacy applications might not be supported.

**Solution:** Perform an application compatibility assessment. Tools like the Microsoft Application Compatibility Toolkit can help identify potential issues. For applications that are not compatible, consider alternatives or workarounds, such as using Windows Virtual Desktop.

### 3. **Data Migration**

**Challenge:** Migrating data, including user profiles and settings, can be complex and time-consuming.

**Solution:** Use the User State Migration Tool (USMT) to automate the migration of user profiles and settings. This tool can help ensure that user data is preserved during the transition.

### 4. **Network Bandwidth**

**Challenge:** The migration process can put a significant load on your network, especially if you have a large number of devices to migrate.

**Solution:** Plan the migration in phases to spread out the network load. Use Intune’s Delivery Optimization feature to reduce bandwidth consumption by allowing devices to share content with each other.

### 5. **Security and Compliance**

**Challenge:** Ensuring that security and compliance policies are maintained during and after the migration is critical.

**Solution:** Review and replicate your Configuration Manager security policies in Intune. Use Intune’s compliance policies and conditional access features to enforce security requirements. Regularly monitor and update these policies to adapt to new threats.

### 6. **User Training and Support**

**Challenge:** Users may need training on new processes and tools introduced with Intune.

**Solution:** Develop a comprehensive training program for end-users and IT staff. Provide resources such as tutorials, webinars, and documentation to help them get up to speed. Establish a support system to address any issues that arise during the transition.

### 7. **Managing Hybrid Environments**

**Challenge:** During the migration, you may need to manage a hybrid environment where both Configuration Manager and Intune are in use.

**Solution:** Use co-management capabilities to manage devices with both Configuration Manager and Intune. This allows you to gradually transition workloads to Intune while maintaining control over your existing Configuration Manager environment.

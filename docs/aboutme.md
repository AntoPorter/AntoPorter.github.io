# About Me

Gday, I'm Anthony Porter, but most people just call me Anto. Im from Perth, Western Australia, born and raised. With 15 years of experience in IT so far, I've spent the last 5 years focusing purely on Microsoft cloud technologies. I have worked in many industries, though predominantly local government-based.

My Cloud journey began in Microsoft Cloud Managed Services helpdesk, then Cloud Infrastructure based projects, eventually leading me to specialize in Cloud Security. Currently, I work for Canon Business Services ANZ where I currently am a Cloud Security Architect.

My expertise lies in Microsoft Intune and Defender XDR, and I am passionate about using these tools to enhance security and streamline operations. I believe in the “KISS” model – **Keep It Simple Stupid**. Too often, people complicate things unnecessarily (and almost certainly leading to confusion), where I prefer to streamline processes to achieve the same outcomes efficiently. This philosophy guides my approach to every project, ensuring that solutions are secure, effective and user-friendly.

Throughout my career, I've earned a range of Microsoft Certifications and have been honored with multiple 'Spirit Awards' for my contributions at CBS ANZ regarding work ethic and team culture. I am becoming a regular at our Perth based Microsoft Security Meetup user group, where I plan to spread my knowledge to those in attendance in future events.

Outside of work, I cherish spending time with my amazing wife and little boy. While I used to be an avid competitive FPS gamer and Twitch streamer (under the alias 'redsnoW'), those days are behind me. Nowadays, I've taken up tinkering with my Subaru and collecting Hot Wheels (yep, those little cars in the candy isle of grocery shops) – what started as a hobby for my son has turned into a passion of mine. How wrong I was to believe it was to be a cheap hobby, I guess no hobbies are "cheap".

# About Me

Hi, My name is Anthony Porter and I'm a Cloud Security Architect, specializing in Microsoft Intune and Defender XDR. 

I'm all about using tech and security to keep organizations safe in this crazy digital world. I'm an avid user of Microsoft Azure, secure cloud computing, and designing solutions that fit what customers need. 

I work closely with different teams to make sure security controls are in place, so businesses can use cloud tech without worrying about their important stuff.
